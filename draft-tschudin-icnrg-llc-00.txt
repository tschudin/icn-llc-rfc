1.  Introduction

   This document specifies a logical link control (LLC) protocol to
   establish a secure association between two endpoints running ICN
   software.  It consists of a negotiation method to explore, configure,
   and manage the essential parameters for communication, permitting to
   switch from unsecured message exchange to encrypted and authenticated
   communications.  It also supports the dynamic creation of logical
   links on a per-protocol basis, permitting to use the link for
   multiple ICN protocols such as CCNx and NDN, in parallel.

   It is assumed that two endpoints executing the ICN-LLC protocol have
   already discovered each other and configured their lower-layer
   transport mechanism to enable bidirectional communication.  A single
   session is establish over this link for end-to-end control.  This
   session is used to control, for example, the session (and in
   consequence also the ICN protocols') MTU size before encryption is
   turned on between the two endpoints.  Within this session, encrypted
   logical channels, called threads, are established both for control
   and for production traffic.  Each endpoint is authenticated during
   this stage.

   The hierarchy of control in ICN-LLC is shown below.

   All control (e.g., negotiation) messages follow an Remote Procedure
   Call-style (RPC) model.  That is, an RPC-request has an identity for
   the parent context (session) and a unique call identifier, an action
   (verb) that identifies the action to be done as well as additional
   action-specific parameters.  Each RPC-request is followed by an RPC-
   response which specifies the result of the operation, e.g., an OK
   flag or a FAIL flag with some useful error information.

   Scope of document:

   The rest of this document introduces definitions and notation used in
   the description of the ICN-LLC protocol, outlines the relevant
   concepts and then provides a high-level description of the protocol
   (along with message content) as well as the encoding details of each
   message.  A full encoding example completes this document.

2.  Definitions and Notation

   The following terms are used:

   o  endpoint: A (session) endpoint which is capable of supporting at
      least one ICN protocol, for example an IP node reachable via UDP.

   o  link: A bidirectional datagram service between two endpoints
      (e.g., UDP, Ethernet).

   o  session: A semi-permanent context in which (possibly encrypted)
      information is exchanged over a link between two endpoints.

   o  session manager: A control unit responsible for managing a session
      between two endpoints.

   o  thread, or logical link: An isolated and ephemeral context managed
      by a session manager in which encrypted traffic is sent between
      two endpoints.

   o  RPC-request: A request to perform an RPC action from a sender to a
      receiver.

   o  RPC-response: A response to an RPC-request sent from RPC-request
      receiver to the RPC-request sender.

3.  ICN-LLC Concepts

3.1.  Assumptions

   The ICN-LLC protocol makes the following assumptions:

   (1) The communication parameters necessary to communicate over a link
   are established before the protocol is executed.  This includes
   settings that, for example, enable bidirectional firewall traversal.

   (2) The underlying link protocol provides the most basic ability to
   frame/encapsulate and move an arbitrary (up to some maximum) sized
   payload from one endpoint to another.

   (3) Each endpoint has a cryptographic identity and can prove its
   identity to the other endpoints over the respective links.

   (4) To this end, endpoints are pre-configured with one or more trust
   anchors permitting them to identity other endpoints that they trust
   i.e., those endpoints that are allowed to participate in the
   execution of the ICN-LLC protocol.  These identities could be
   ascertained online (making us of the trust anchors) or be pre-
   configured manually by system administrators.

           links of the session are encrypted and authenticated.

3.3.  API for Endpoint Clients

   The goal of the ICN-LLC protocol and its session manager is to expose
   an API that enables a run-time environment to connect local ICN
   software (clients, like for example a CCNx forwarder) to a remote
   peer by reusing the ICN-LLC's secured link.

   This client API provides access to very basic services to
   interconnect ICN peers.  In a UNIX environment, the API could be
   structured as follows (in C syntax):

     int icnllc_init(linkaddr *local, credentials *me);
     int icnllc_register(int icnllcHandler, protoID *pid, fct *upcall);
     int icnllc_deregister(int registerNr);
     int icnllc_openSession(int handler, linkaddr *peer, trustanchors *t);
     int icnllc_openThread(int sessionHandler, protoID *pid);
     int icnllc_write(int threadHandler, char *msg, int len);
     int icnllc_read(int threadHandler, char *buf, int nbyte);
     int icnllc_closeThread(int threadHandler);
     int icnllc_closeSession(int sessionHandler)
     int icnllc_fini(int icnllcHandler);

   Wherever possible, ICN-LLC makes use of names rather than numbers to
   identify parameters and entities.  For example, protocol identifiers
   are drawn from a string-based name space (the string IS the
   identifier):

      typedef char* protoID;
      #define PROTOID_CCNX07  "/proto/icn/ccnx.2009"
      #define PROTOID_CCNX10  "/proto/icn/ccnx.2015"
      #define PROTOID_NDN     "/proto/icn/ndn.2013"

3.4.  Client work flow

   ICN clients e.g., forwarders, will use the API as follows.  A NDN
   router waiting for session establishment from other peers would issue
   this sequence of actions (without showing error handling):

      llc = icnllc_init(&myUDP, &myCredentials);
      ndn = icnllc_register(llc, "/proto/icn/ndn.2013", NDNupcall);
      // ... serve thread establishment in NDNupcall()
      icnllc_deregister(ndn);
      icnllc_fini(llc);

   A CCNx router wanting to establish a secure link to a peer would be
   programmed as follows:

   llc = icnllc_init(&myUDP, &myCredentials);
   s = icnllc_openSession(llc, &remoteUDP, &myTrustAnchor);

   peer = icnllc_openThread(s, "/proto/icn/ccnx.2015");
   // ... encrypted and authenticated write and read:
   // icnllc_write(peer, data, datalen);
   // icnllc_read(peer, &buf, sizeof*buf);

   // parallel thread for client-level remote mgmt actions (also secured):
   peerMgmt = icnllc_openThread(s, "/proto/icn/ccnx.2015.mgmt");
   // ...
   icnllc_closeThread(peerMgmt);

   icnllc_closeThread(peer);
   icnllc_closeSession(s)
   icnllc_fini(llc);

4.  Link-level RPC and Logical Link Traffic

   All configuration state of a session, including state related to the
   session's threads, are managed by remote procedure operations.  To
   this end, two message types "RPC-request" and "RPC-response" are
   needed.  A third message type serves to recognize actual production
   (= non-control) traffic, called "logical link traffic".

   In the subsequent sections we describe these three message types and
   their fields, as well as the INC-LLC protocol, in an encoding-neutral
   way using prefixed lists.  For example, a packet with the fields

     +----------------------------+
     | f1 | f2 | more fields here |
     +----------------------------+

   will be represented as

     f1(f2, more fields here)

   That is, a parethesis pair is used as a notation for a list.  The
   empty list is either shown as () or NIL.

   We first show the data structures corresponding to the three message
   types before explaining each of them.

     rpc-request (RID, verb, parameter-list)
     rpc-response(RID, OK|FAIL, result-list|reason-list)
     llt-message (LID, blob)

     RID = (SID, nonce)         # request ID
     LID = (SID, TID)           # logical link ID
     SID = (intval1, intval2)   # session ID
     TID = (intval1, intval2)   # thread ID

               Figure 3: The three message types of ICN-LLC.

4.1.  RPC-request

   (See also Figure [#llc-msgs]) An RPC-request message carries an ID
   that identifyies the request instance (RID) as well as a verb (= name
   of the remote procedure) and an optional payload with the list of
   parameters.

   The RID carries two pieces of information: The current session's ID
   (SID) comes first, followed by a nonce.  The role of the SID is to
   refer to previously established state and must be kept constant for
   all messages sent inside the established session.  The Nonce is
   randomly chosen for each new RPC-request and permits to retransmit a
   request in case the sender thinks that the request or the reply got
   lost.  It is not a sequence number, though.

4.2.  RPC-response

   An RPC-response is always the reaction to a received RPC-request.  It
   contains a copy of the request's RID so that the requestor can
   correlate the answer with the pending request.  Furthermore, the RPC-
   response has a verb similar to the RPC-request.  However, the
   permitted verbs are limited to either "OK" or "FAIL".

Internet-Draft                   ICN-LLC                     August 2015


4.3.  Logical Link Traffic

   Logical Link Traffic refers to the messages that travel inside a
   logical link (called thread).  This message type has two fields:
   logical link ID and payload.

   The logical link is identified by a tuple that refers to the session
   context (SID) as well as the thread to which this message belongs to.
   In fact, the (SID, TID) tuple is a "network pointer" into the other
   end's function space [NetPtrs].  The thread ID is also a tuple, in
   this case of two numbers.  Often, threads are used in pairs (for
   bidirectional interconnection of ICN clients) in which case the
   tuple's values are swapped.

5.  Negotiation Tasks

   We now describe the major negotiation tasks (RPC calls) that make up
   the LLC protocol.

   {XXX.cft: say something about the negotiation style: select/set
   instead of haggle}

   {XXX.cft: say something about the required RPC failure semantics (at-
   least-once vs at-most-once)}

   Any side can initiate a remote procedure call at any time.  It is
   suggested to limit the number of RPCs that one side issues in
   parallel to four (including nesting).  For simplicity, we refer to
   each of the endpoints in the protocol as Q for Questioner and R for
   Responder.

5.1.  Session Initialization

   The session initialization task is the first step in establishing and
   using a link between two endpoints.  Assuming such a communication
   link for the underlying transport protocol is established, it is done
   by the following RPC exchange.

   Q-->R: rpc-request((SID-1,0), nonce), START-SESSION, ())

   On success:
     Q<--R: rpc-response((SID-1,0), nonce), OK, list(SID-2))
   On failure:
     Q<--R: rpc-response((SID-1,0), nonce), FAIL, list(<reason>))

            Figure 4: Session Initialization Message Exchange.

Internet-Draft                   ICN-LLC                     August 2015


   After that exchange was executed, both ends will use the session ID
   consisting of SID-1 and SID-2 i.e., (SID-1, SID-2) in order to refer
   to this new session.  In the following we abbreviate this tuple to
   SID.

   Note that session initialization leaves the two endpoints in an
   unsecure state until they have executed the secure association task
   (see below).

   {Question: how to handle/mitigate an attacker injecting such "reset"
   messages?} {CAW: each side could store a hash preimage that is
   revealed during the SA step, but this induces state.  If these two
   operations are separated, then some state is necessary.}

5.2.  Inspection (Get MTU)

   Inspection messages may be used to recover generic information from
   an endpoint, e.g., the preferred MTU size.  The RPC exchange for an
   inspection message is as follows.

   Q-->R: rpc-request(SID, nonce), "lookup", ("/conf/preferredMTU"))

   On success:
     Q<--R: rpc-response((SID, nonce), OK, (<MTU value>))
   On failure:
     Q<--R: rpc-response((SID, nonce), FAIL, (<reason>))

                  Figure 5: Remote inspection (for MTU).

   Inspection messages may be used to query any well-named object from
   the recipient endpoint.  In the example above, the inspection for the
   preferred MTU would usually occur before establishing a secure
   session association (SA).  Thus, before SA, the contents of the RPC
   request and response are unencrypted.  However, after a SA is
   established, all inspection messages will be encrypted like other
   link traffic.

5.3.  Secure Association Establishment

   The secure association (SA) establishment message exchange is used to
   create a secure session over a given link.  This enables all
   subsequent traffic, including RPC exchanges, to be authenticated and
   encrypted.  The goal is for each endpoint to authenticate the entity
   running on the other endpoint of a given link, and to then establish
   shared symmetric keys to perform authenticated encryption of all
   traffic that follows the exchange.  Currently, we specify a simple
   challenge-response mutual authentication protocol.  This can be
   replaced with any functionally equivalent protocol.

Internet-Draft                   ICN-LLC                     August 2015


   Note that the SA involves nested RPCs: The responder to the initial
   RPC request will do an RPC in reverse direction in order to
   authenticate the requestor.

   Note also that Encrypt(K,M) stands for the ciphertext resulting from
   applying key K to message M and Signature(K,M) for a signature of M
   using key KL.

   Q-->R: rpc-request((SID, nonceA), "prove-identity",
                      (NIL, <optionsA>, <keyshareA>,
                       NIL, <challengeA-1, challengeA-2>))

   Q<--R: rpc-request((SID, nonceB), "prove-identity"
                      (nonceA, <optionsB>, <keyshareB>,
                       NIL, <challengeB-1, challengeB-2>))

   Q-->R: rpc-response((SID, nonceB), OK,
                       (Signature(key-Q, challengeB-1),
                        Encrypt(keyAB, (TIDa, challengeB-2, nonceB)))

   Q<--R: rpc-response((SID, nonceA), OK,
                       (Signature(key-R, challengeA-1),
                        Encrypt(keyAB, (TIDb, challengeA-2, nonceA)))

     Figure 6: Secure Association with two challenge-response rounds.

   In the first message, the value NIL is used to represent an empty
   nonce.

   The fields named optionsA and optionsB are key-value data structures
   that contain the following information, at a minimum:

   o  Preferred identity information (e.g., the form of signature
      algorithm to use when processing the challenge and response).

   o  Diffie Hellman group parameters

   The key key-{Q,R} is a private key of {Q,R} or a symmetric key shared
   between Q and R.

   Lastly, keyAB is the key material derived from the output of the
   Diffie Hellman exchange with the shares keyshareA and keyshareB.
   That is, logically,

   keyAB = DH(keyshareA, keyshareB)

   When a failure occurs in the secure association RPC (not shown in the
   diagram above), the recipient replies with an error code (in clear)

   as in the Inspection message case and does not establish a new (or
   replace an old) secured logical link.

   Otherwise the secure association request succeeded and from this
   point in time on the two endpoints will exchange their control
   messages in encrypted form inside threads.

   To this end, the protocol above exchanged and authenticated two
   endpoint-chosen numbers TIDa and TIDb.  The thread starting from the
   side that chose the TIDa value, will use thread ID TIDAB = (TIDa,
   TIDb) while the other side can use thread identifier TIDBA =
   (TIDb,TIDa) to reply.  Subsequently we will refer to the respective
   logical link identifiers that result from this as LIDAB=(SID,TIDAB)
   and LIDBA=(SID,TIDBA)

   For example, the remote inspection RPC can now be executed in a
   secured fashion as follows:

   Q-->R: llt-message(LIDAB, Encrypt(keyAB,
                      rpc-request((SID, nonce),
                                  "lookup", ("/conf/preferredMTU"))))
   On success:
   Q<--R: llt-message(LIDBA, Encrypt(keyAB,
                      rpc-response((SID, nonce),
                                   OK, (<MTU value>))))

                 Figure 7: Thread-Local Encapsulated RPC.

5.4.  Set MTU

   Setting the MTU is a standard message in the LLC protocol that has
   the following RPC exchange format.

Q-->R: llt-message(LIDAB, Encrypt(keyAB,
                   rpc-request((SID, nonce), "set", ("/conf/MTU", <value>))))

On success:
  Q<--R: llt-message(LIDBA, Encrypt(keyAB,
                     rpc-response((SID, nonce), OK, (<value>))))
On failure:
  Q<--R: llt-message(LIDBA, Encrypt(keyAB,
                     rpc-response((SID, nonce), FAIL, (<reason>))))

5.5.  Create Logical Link (thread)

   After a session and SA have been established, the protocol-specific
   links (threads) must be created.  This is done with the following
   exchange.  The number 5 shown below is arbitrary and signals for this
   specific task that Q or R can choose their part of the thread ID at
   will.

   Q-->R: llt-message(LIDAB, Encrypt(keyAB,
                      rpc-request((SID, nonce), "create-thread",
                      (TID-5a, Key-5QR, <icn-protocol-identifier>))))
   On success:
     Q<--R: llt-message(LIDBA, Encrypt(keyAB,
                        rpc-response((SID, nonce), OK, (TID-5b)))
   On failure:
     Q<--R: llt-message(LIDBA, Encrypt(keyAB,
                        rpc-response((SID, nonce), FAIL, (<reason>))))

                 Figure 9: Logical Link (Thread) Creation.

   This creates a new thread whose identifier is the tuple (TID-5a, TID-
   5b).  That is, for messages send through this thread, questioner Q
   will use the logical link ID LID5Q = (SID, (TID-5a, TID-5b)), whereas
   the responder R will use LID5R = (SID, (TID-5b, TID-5a)).

   Note that the messages will be encrypted by the symmetric key Key-5QR
   that was unilaterally chosen by the initiator of this RPC.  Since
   each thread is owned and controlled by the session manager, it is
   sufficient for the session manager to simply derive and impose a new
   encryption key Key-5QR for the thread during creation.  In other
   words, it is not necessary to perform another multi-round Diffie
   Hellman key exchange.

   The thread creation needs a remote target, expressed in form of an
   client identifier "icn-protocol-identifier".  If the new thread
   cannot be bound to such a client, the RPC may fail.  A partial list
   of failure reasons:

   o  "Protocol not supported"

   o  "Invalid key size"

   Currently, each thread will use the same encryption algorithm and
   parameters for their respective traffic.  This could be changed by
   allowing endpoints to negotiate these parameters during the thread
   creation exchange.

5.6.  Destroy Logical Link (thread)

   Finally, when a thread is finished, it must be destroyed and all
   state must be recycled.  This is done with the following exchange.

Q-->R: llt-message(LIDAB, encrypt(KeyAB,
                   rpc-request((SID, nonce), "destroy-thread", (TID-5)))

Q<--R: llt-message(LIDBA, encrypt(Key-AB,
                   rpc-response((SID, nonce), OK, NIL)))

               Figure 10: Logical Link (Thread) Destruction.

   After this exchange, both parties tear down and recycle their local
   state.  That is, both threads (TID-5a,TID-5b) and (TID-5b,TID-5a)
   will be destroyed at the same time.  This destroy action request is
   idempotent; attempting to destroy a non-existent thread will yield an
   OK response from the recipient.

   Note that the two threads representing the logical control link,
   named (SID, TIDBA) and (SID, TIDAB) above, cannot be close.  Instead,
   the "destroy-session" RPC must be used.

6.  Encoding (of RPC and parameters)

   Variation of Rivest's symbolic expressions [SEXPR]

   in-memory format of sexp, relation to TLV

   highest bit to distinguish atom from list

   0+len   octet string
   1+len   list

   A s-expression's length has a variable len encoding. X stands for the
   list-bit:

   Encoding                      len bits  len range

   x0ll llll                       6 bits  0 .. 63
   x10l llll llll llll            13 bits  64 .. 8191
   x110 llll llll llll llll llll  20 bits  8192 .. 2^20-1

6.1.  Minimum MTU and Fragmentation of LLC messages

   None of the three message types (RPC-request, RPC-response, LLT-
   traffic) may be fragmented.
